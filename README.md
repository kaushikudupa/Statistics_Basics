An attempt to explain some basic concepts of Statistics.

Why Statistics?

The need for development of Statistics as a discipline of study stems from our curiosity to understand the world around us. Without our knowledge, we make use of Statistics to navigate through situations in our lives. We develop an understanding of the world by observation. This involves paying undivided attention to the subject of observation, scrutinise its behaviour, monitor its progress over time, and identify the patterns. These patterns standout only when there is innate randomness in the behaviour of the subject. Randomness is the background against which the patterns standout. Through various procedures, Statistics tries to differentiates the patterns (signals) from the randomness (noise). Therefore, randomness is just as important as patterns for Statistics to be effective.

The most simple way to understand the crux of Statistics is with the following analogy. Let us suppose you want to have a glass of Orange juice. The procedure to obtain this is to take a few Oranges, put it in a juicer, and voil√† - there's have a glass of Orange juice. The raw material is turned into desired output by subjecting it to a certain process. Statistics also follows the same format. In Statistics, data is the Oranges, algorithm is the juicer, and models (or other desired outputs) is the glass of juice. 

This analogy provides two other key insights into how Statistics works. The first of these is pertaining to the data. The quality of the glass of juice depends on the quality of the Oranges. Similarly, the result of any Statistical analysis is heavily dependent on the quality of the data. High quality data yields high quality results. To anticipate good results from poor quality data is a fool's errand.

The other insight is relevant to the algorithm. Let us suppose we want a glass of Sugarcane juice instead. It would be foolish to put the Sugarcane into a juicer. The machinery required to extract juice from Sugarcane is entirely different from that of Oranges. Similarly, based on the requirement, the right Statistical machinery must be deployed to obtain the desired results. There is no one size fits all.
